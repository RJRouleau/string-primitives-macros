# string-primitives-macros

This program was the final assignment for Computer Architecture and Assembly Language at Oregon State University. It is written in MASM x86 assembly language. 

The program prompts the user to provide 10 signed decimal integers then displays a list of the numbers, their sum, and their truncated average. If a number is to large to fit in a 32 bit register, an error is displayed and the user is prompted to try again.
